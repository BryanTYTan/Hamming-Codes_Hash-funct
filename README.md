# Hamming_Hash-1
Learning Hamming Codes &amp; Hash Functions

__Hamming code to do list__
- [x] String to binary conversion
- [x] Binary to string conversion
- [x] Hamming function
- [x] Intentional error function
- [x] Reverting Hamming function
- [x] unit tests

> Hamming code contains some redundancy which could be improved.

__Hashing Code to do List__
- [x] General Purpose Hashing Function
- [x] Simple collision check

> Could perhaps standardize it to 256 bits or a set length.
> Not secure nor fully resilient to collision but consistent
